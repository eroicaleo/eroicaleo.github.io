# Chapter 3 Factorisation of Polynomials

## 3.1 The Euclidean Algorithm

* Proposition 3.1 (Division Algorithm) Let $f$ and $g$ be polynomials over $K$, and
suppose that $f$ is non-zero. Then there exists unique polynomials $q$ and $r$ over $K$,
such that $g = fq+r$ and $\partial r$ < $\partial f$ .

* Existence: by induction. $K$ is a field is very important in the proof.
* Uniqueness: Assume

$$
g = fq_1+r_1 = fq_2+r_2
$$
Then

$$
f(q_1-q_2) = r_1-r_2
$$
Then if $q_1-q_2 \neq 0$, the degree of left side is strictly greater than the right side.
The equation can not holds.

* Definition for $g|f$ and $g \nmid f$
* Definition for highest common factor (hcf).

* Lemma 3.5 (hcf is unique except a constant factors)

* Proof: assume $d, e$ are all hcf of $f, g$. Then

$$
e|d \implies d = ke
$$
Then the degree of $d$ is higher or equal than that of $e$. For the same reason,
the degree of $e$ is higher or equal than that of $d$. Then $k$ must be a constant.

* Algorithm 3.6 Euclid's algorithm to find hcf.

$$
f= r_{-1} = q_1r_0+r_1 \\
r_0 = q_2r_1+r_2 \\
\cdots \\
r_i = q_{i+2} r_{i+1} + r_{i+2} \\
\dots \\
r_s = q_{s+2}r_{s+1}
$$

* Theorem 3.7 $r_{s+1}$ is the hcf of $f,g$
* Theorem 3.9 if $d$ is hcf of $f,g$, we can express $d = af+bg$.

* Both of the proof just need to use Euclid's algorithm.

## 3.2 Irreducibility

* **_Definition 3.10_** : A non-constant polynomial $f$ over a subring $R$ of $\mathbb{C}$ is reducible
  if it's a product of two polynomials over $R$ of smaller degree. Otherwise, it's irreducible.
* **_Theorem 3.12_** : A non-zero polynomial over a subring $R$ of $\mathbb{C}$ is a product of
  irreducible polynomials over $R$
* *_Proof_*: by induction. Either $g$ is irreducible or $g=hk$ such that
  $\partial{h} < \partial{g}$ and $\partial{k} < \partial{g}$.

* **_Definition 3.14_** : If $f$ and $g$ are polynomials over $K$ of $\mathbb{C}$ with hcf
  equals to 1, then we say $f$ and $g$ are coprime, or $f$ is prime to $g$ .

* **_Lemma 3.15_** : Let $K$ be a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$, $f$ is a irreducible polynomial
  over $K$, $g, h$ are polynomials over $K$. If $f | gh$, then either $f|g$ or $f|h$.

* **_Proof_** : We need to use Theorem 3.9. Assume $f \nmid g$, then
  We can find $a, b$ such that $1 = af+bg$.
  Then $h = afh + bgh$, $f|afh$ and $f|bgh$. So $f|h$.

* **_Theorem 3.16_** : For any subfield $K$ of $\mathbb{C}$, factorization of polynomials over $K$
  into irreducible polynomials is unique up to constant factors.

* **_Proof_** : We need to use Lemma 3.15. Assume $h = f_1\dots f_r = g_1 \dots g_s$, where
  $f_i, g_i$ are irreducible polynomials. Then from lemma 3.15 $f_1 | g_i$ for some i, say
  $i = 1$. Then $g_1 = k_1 f_1, k_1 \in K$. For the same reason $g_i = k_i, k_i \in K$ for
  all $i = 1, \dots, r$. And we must have $r = s$ also.

## 3.3 Gauss's Lemma

* **_Lemma 3.15 (Gauss's Lemma)_** : Let $f$ be an irreducible polynomial over $\mathbb{Z}$,
  then $f$, considered as an polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$, is also irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.

* **_Proof_** : Assume $g, h$ are polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$, and $f = gh$. Then we can find
  an integer $n$ such that $nf = g'h'$ such that $g', h' \in \mathbb{Z}[t]$.
  Assume the following:

$$
g' = g_0 + g_1t + \dots + g_r t^r \\
h' = h_0 + h_1t + \dots + h_s t^s
$$
