# Chapter 3 Factorisation of Polynomials

## 3.1 The Euclidean Algorithm

* Proposition 3.1 (Division Algorithm) Let $f$ and $g$ be polynomials over $K$, and
suppose that $f$ is non-zero. Then there exists unique polynomials $q$ and $r$ over $K$,
such that $g = fq+r$ and $\partial r$ < $\partial f$ .

* Existence: by induction. $K$ is a field is very important in the proof.
* Uniqueness: Assume

$$
g = fq_1+r_1 = fq_2+r_2
$$
Then

$$
f(q_1-q_2) = r_1-r_2
$$
Then if $q_1-q_2 \neq 0$, the degree of left side is strictly greater than the right side.
The equation can not holds.

* Definition for $g|f$ and $g \nmid f$
* Definition for highest common factor (hcf).

* Lemma 3.5 (hcf is unique except a constant factors)

* Proof: assume $d, e$ are all hcf of $f, g$. Then

$$
e|d \implies d = ke
$$
Then the degree of $d$ is higher or equal than that of $e$. For the same reason,
the degree of $e$ is higher or equal than that of $d$. Then $k$ must be a constant.

* Algorithm 3.6 Euclid's algorithm to find hcf.

$$
f= r_{-1} = q_1r_0+r_1 \\
r_0 = q_2r_1+r_2 \\
\cdots \\
r_i = q_{i+2} r_{i+1} + r_{i+2}
$$

* Theorem 3.7 $r_{s+1}$ is the hcf of $f,g$
* Theorem 3.9 if $d$ is hcf of $f,g$, we can express $d = af+bg$.

* Both of the proof just need to use Euclid's algorithm.
