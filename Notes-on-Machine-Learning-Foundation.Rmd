# Week 2

## 1. When can machine learn?

### Hypothesis: 'perceptron'

Each "tall" **w** represents a hypothesis _h_ & multiply the "tall" **x**.

Perceptron is equivalent to linear (binary) classifier.

### Perceptron Learning Algorithm

want g is close to f (hard when _f_ unknow)

Ideally, g(xn) = f(xn) = yn

Difficulty: H is infinite space.

Idea: start from some g0, and correct its mistakes on D.

Algorithm:
1. Find a mistakes xn(t)
2. Updates w(t+1) <- w(t) + yn(t)\*xn(t)
Geometric explaination: if the angle between w and x is too big, we make it
smaller, otherwise, make it bigger.

A fault confessed is half redressed.

## Guarantee of PLA

The normalized inner product of w_f and w_t will increase monotonously.
It will stop at certain iteration.

## Non separable data

Pros: simple to implement, fast, work for any dimension d.
Cons:
* Assume linearly separable.
* not fully sure how long halting takes (rho depends on wf)
