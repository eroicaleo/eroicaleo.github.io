# Week1

## Setting up playground

To get the help on something, there are 3 ways:

1. To use the right panel
2. Hold the "alt" or "option" button
3. The menu bar

## Preference setup

The most interest part is "font and color"
Another important is "account"

## Debug

In the (lldb) command line, `po` to print object.
`nil` means null.

The bug is because the image is not there. We drag the image to the Asset folder.
We can also view the variable by move the mouse on it.

Debug view hierarchy is cool.
