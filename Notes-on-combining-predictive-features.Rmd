# Lecture 7 Blending and Bagging

## Motivation of Aggregation

* An Aggregation Story

How to combine $g_1, g_2, \dots, g_T$ to a $g_t(x)$

1. Select best one: validation!
$$
G(x) = g_{t_*}(x)\ \text{with } \underset{t\in{1,2,\dots,T}}{\text{argmin}}\ E_{val}(g_t^-)
$$
2. Mix uniformly
$$
G(x) = \text{sign } (\sum_{1}^{T} 1 \cdot g_t(x))
$$
3. Mix non-uniformly
$$
G(x) = \text{sign } (\sum_{1}^{T} \alpha_t \cdot g_t(x))
$$
  * include case 1: $\alpha_t = \| E_{val}(g_t^-)\ \text{smallest } \|$
  * include case 2: $\alpha_t = 1$
4. Combine conditionally
    * Some one is good at tech stock, others are good at energy stock
    * include case 3.

$$
G(x) = \text{sign } (\sum_{1}^{T} q_t(x) \cdot g_t(x))
$$

**_Aggregation: mix or combine hypothesis to get better performance_, it's a rich family**

* Selection by validation

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
