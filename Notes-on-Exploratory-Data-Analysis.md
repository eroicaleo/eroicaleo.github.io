----------------------------------

1. Always show comparison, compare evidence between 2 different hypothesis.

3. Show multivariate data, some variables are confounding variables.
4. Integration evidence, different modes of evidence.
5. Describe and document the appropriate labels.
6. Content is King.

03 Exploratory Graphs
---------------------

Why we need graphs?
1. We want to understand the data
2. We want to find patterns
3. To suggest modeling strategies
4. To debug analysis

Characteristics of exploratory graphs
1. made quickly
2. made in large numbers
3. goal is for personal understandings
