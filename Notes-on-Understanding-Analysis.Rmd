# Chapter 1
## section 1.3 The Axiom of Completeness

* **_1.3.0 Axiom of Completeness_** Every non empty set of real numbers that is bounded
  above has a least upper bound.

* **_Lemma 1.3.8_** Assume $s \in R$ is an upper bound for a set $A \$

### Exercises

* **_Exercise 1.3.3_**

(a) 3 For any $a \in A$, a is an upper bound of $B$, thus $\sup B <= a$. Thus $\sup B$ is a lower
bound of $A$. For any lower bound of A $b \in B, b <= \sup B$, thus $\sup B = \inf A$.
(b) The greatest lower bound can be deduced from (a)

* **_Exercise 1.3.9_**

(a) Assume $\epsilon = \sup B - \sup A > 0$, according to lemma 1.3.8, there is $b \in B$ such
    that $b > \sup B - \epsilon = \sup A$. So $b$ is an upper bound of $A$.
(b)

* **_Exercise 1.3.10 (Cut Property)_**

(a) Let $c = \sup A$. Then for $x \in A, x <= c$. For $b \in B$, because $a < b, \forall a \in A$,
    Then $b$ is an upper bound of $A$, therefore, $c \le b$.
(b) The other way. Let $B$ be the set of all upper bounds of $A$. $c$ is the cut, then $c \ge a$
    for all $a \in A$. Then $c$ is an upper bound of $A$. Let $b$ be an upper bound, then $b \in B$. Then $c \le b$, then $c = \sup A$.
(c) Let $A = \{a|a^2<2\}, B = \{b|b^2>2\}$.

* **_Exercise 1.3.11_**

(a) True. For $a \in A$, we have $a \in B$, then $a <= \sup B$. So $\sup B$ is an upper bound
    of $A$. Therefore $\sup A \le \sup B$.
(b) True. Let $c = (\sup A + \inf B) / 2$, the $\inf B > c > \sup A$. So
$$
a \le \sup A < c < \inf B \le b
$$

(c) False. Let $A = \{a| a \in \mathbb{Q}, a^2 < 2\}$, $B = \{b| b \in \mathbb{Q}, b^2 > 2\}$ and
    $c = 2$. Then $\sup A = \inf B = \sqrt{2}$ .
