# 1 The Integers

## 1.1 The Well-Ordering Principle and Induction

***definition 1.1*** Let $a, b ∈ Z$. We say that ‘b divides a’, or ‘b is a divisor of a’, or ‘a is a multiple of b’, and write $b | a$, if there is an integer $c$ such that $a = bc$.
 
***lemma1.2*** If $b|a$ and $a \ne 0$,then $|b|≤|a|$.

***FACT (Well-ordering principle)*** Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers
contains a least element.

Next

## 1.2

## 1.3 Greatest Common Divisors

***definition 1.5*** Let $a, b ∈ \mathbb{Z}$. We say that a nonnegative integer $d$ is the ‘greatest common divisor’ of a and b, denoted $\gcd(a, b)$ or simply $(a, b)$, if

* $d | a$ and $d | b$ and
* if $c | a$ and $c | b$, then $c | d$.

* Notes: for the 2nd part, not to use $c \le d$.

***theorem 1.8*** Let $a, b$ be integers. Then the greatest common divisor $d = \gcd(a, b)$ is an integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$. That is, there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $d = ma + nb$.

In fact, if $a$ and $b$ are not both 0, then $\gcd(a, b)$ is the smallest positive linear combination of $a$ and $b$.

* Sketch of proof: Use the well-ordering principle.

***corollary 1.9*** Let $a, b$ be integers. Then $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ if and only if 1 may be expressed as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$.

***definition 1.10***  We say that a and b are relatively prime if $\gcd(a, b) = 1$.

***corollary 1.11*** Let $a, b, c$ be integers. If $a | bc$ and $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $a | c$.

***theorem 1.14 (Euclidean algorithm)*** Let $a, b$ be integers, with $b \ne 0$. Then, with notation as above, $\gcd(a, b)$ equals the last nonzero remainder $r_n$.

***lemma 1.15*** Let $a, b, q, r$ be integers, with $b \ne 0$, and assume that $a = bq + r$. Then $\gcd (a, b) = \gcd (b,r)$.

Proof. Assume $\gcd (a, b) = r'$, then $r' | r$. And assume $\gcd (b,r) = r''$, then $r'' | a$, so $r'' | r'$. On the other hand $r' | r''$, so $r' = r''$.

The textbook's approach is also clean, it shows the $a,b$ and $b,r$ have
the same set of common divisor.

## 1.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

***definition 1.17*** An integer $p$ is ‘irreducible’ if $p \neq ±1$ and the only divisors of $p$ are $±1, ±p$. An integer $\neq 0$,  $\neq ±1$ is ‘reducible’ or ‘composite’ if it is not irreducible.

***lemma 1.18*** Assume that $p$ is an irreducible integer and that $b$ is not a multiple of $p$. Then $b$ and $p$ are relatively prime, that is, $\gcd(p, b) = 1$.

Proof. Assume $c | p$ and $c | b$, because $p$ is irreducible, then $c = ±1, ±p$. Since $p \nmid b$, then $c$ can only be 1.

***definition 1.19*** An integer $p$ is ‘prime’ if $p \ne ±1$ and whenever $p$ divides the product $bc$ of two integers $b$, $c$, then $p$ divides $b$ or $p$ divides $c$.

***theorem 1.21*** Let $p ∈ Z$, $p \ne 0$. Then $p$ is prime if and only if it is irreducible.

Proof. Assume $p$ is prime and if $a | p$, so $p = ab$, then $p | a$ or $p | b$. Assume $p|a$, then $a = \pm p$. If $p | b$, then $a = \pm1$. So $p$ is
irreducible.

On the other hand, if $p$ is irreducible and assume $p | bc$. Consider
$\gcd(p, b)$. If $\gcd(p, b) = 1$, then $p | c$. If $\gcd(p, b) = p$, then
$p | b$.

***theorem 1.22***  (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) Every integer $n \ne 0,  ±1$ is
a product of finitely many irreducible integers: $∀n ∈ Z, n \ne 0, n \ne ±1$, there exist
irreducible integers $q_1,..., q_r$ such that

$$
n = q_1 ··· q_r
$$
Proof: The existence, use contradiction and well-ordering principle.
Assume $n$ is the smallest integer that cannot be a product of irreducible integers. And $n$ cannot be irreducible itself. So assume $n = ab$, because
$n$ is the smallest such integer, $a, b$ must be a product of irreducible integers. So we have a contradiction.

The uniqueness, again use contradiction and well-ordering principle.
Assume $n$ is the smallest integer such that it has two different
factorization.
$$
n = q_1 ··· q_r = p_1 ... p_s
$$
Because $q_1$ is prime, so $q_1 | p_1$, but $p_1$ is irreducible, so
$q_1 = p_1$. So

$$
n = q_1 ··· q_r = q_1 ... p_s
$$
And let

$$
m = q_2 ... q_r = p_2 ... p_s
$$

$m < n$ and it has two different factorization. We have a contradiction.

* We will see later $\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD (‘unique factorization domain’).

***proposition 1.25*** Let a, b be nonzero integers, and write

$$
a = 2^{\alpha_2} 3^{\alpha_3} \cdots \\
b = 2^{\beta_2} 3^{\beta_3} \cdots \\
$$

Then the gcd of $a$ and $b$ is the positive integer

$$
d = 2^{\delta_2} 3^{\delta_3} \cdots \\
$$
where $\delta_i = \min(\alpha_i, \beta_i)$.

Proof: If 

$$
c = 2^{\gamma_2} 3^{\gamma_3} \cdots
$$

is a commond divisor. Then $\gamma_i \le \min(\alpha_i, \beta_i) = \delta_i$.
So $c | d$.

* least common multiple (lcm) is similarly obtained by taking exponents $\max(α_i, β_i)$. (The ‘least common multiple’ of $a$
and $b$ is what it says it should be: a number that is a multiple of $a$ and a multiple of $b$,
and such that every common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is a multiple of $l$.)

***corollary 1.27*** Two nonzero integers a, b are relatively prime if and only if they have no common irreducible factor.

## Exercises

***1.2*** ◃ Prove that divisibility is an order relation on the set $Z^{≥0}$ of nonnegative integers. That is, prove that for all positive integers a, b, c:

(i) $a|a$;
(ii) if $a|b$ and $b|c$,then $a|c$;
(iii) if $a|b$ and $b|a$ ,then $a=b$.

Is this order relation a total ordering? Does it have a ‘maximum’? (That is, is there an integer $m$ such that $∀a ∈ Z^{≥0}, a | m?)$

Proof: 

(i) $a = a \cdot 1$
(ii) $b = aa_0, c = bb_0$, so $c = aa_0b_0$. So $a | c$
(iii) From lemma 1.2, $a | b$, so $a \le b$. $b | a$, so $b \le a$. So $a = b$.

This is not a total ordering. Consider $a = 2, b = 3$, $a \nmid b$ and $b \nmid a$.
$0$ is a maximum.

***1.8*** ◃ Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $a$ and $b$ be integers. Prove that $a$ and $b$ have
the same remainder when divided by $n$ if and only if $a − b = nk$ for some integer $k$.

Proof:

if $a − b = nk$, let $a = pn+r, b = qn+s$, then $pn+r = qn+s+kn$.
So
$$
r - s = (p-q-k)n
$$
So $n \mid r-s$. Because $0 \le r, s<n$, so $|r-s| < n$, we must have $r = s$.

On the other hand, if $r = s$, then $a - b = (p - q)n$.

***1.10*** ◃Suppose $\gcd(a,b)=1$. Prove that if $a|c$ and $b|c$,then $ab|c$.

Proof: Since $\gcd(a,b)=1$, we have $ma + nb = 1$. Also assume
$c = ap, c = bq$, then $c = mac + nbc = mabq + nbap = (mq+np)ab$.
So $ab | c$.

***1.11*** Prove that if $a|(b+c)$ and $\gcd(b,c)=1$,then $\gcd(a,b)=1$.

Proof:

$$
b+c = pa, \\
1 = mb + nc, \\
1 = mb+n(pa-b) = (m-n)b + npa.
$$
***1.12*** Prove that if $\gcd(a, c) = 1$ and $\gcd(b, c) = 1$,
then $\gcd(ab, c) = 1$.

Proof:

$$
1 = ma + nc, \\
1 = pb + qc, \\
1 = (ma + nc)(pb + qc) = mpab + (maq+npb+nqc)c
$$
***1.13*** Prove that if $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $\gcd(a^r, b^s) = 1$ for all positive integers $r, s$.

Proof: From 1.12, we know $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, so $\gcd(a^2, b) = 1$.
Then using induction, we can prove $\gcd(a^r, b) = 1$ for all $r$.
Then using 1.12 again, we can prove $\gcd(a^r, b^2) = 1$.
Then using induction again, we can prove $\gcd(a^r, b^s) = 1$

***1.14*** Prove that if $c > 0$, then $\gcd(ca, cb) = c · \gcd(a, b)$.

Proof. Assume $\gcd(ca, cb) = e$, $d = \gcd(a, b)$, then $cd | ca$ and $cd | cb$ so $cd | e$.
Now it's clear $c | e$, then assume $e = cd'$, then $d' | a$ and $d' | b$,
so $d' | d$. So $e = cd' | cd$, so $\gcd(ca, cb) = e = cd$.

***1.15*** Prove that if $c | ab$ and $\gcd(a, c) = d$, then $c | db$.

Proof. Assume $a = dm$ and $c = dn$ and $\gcd(m, n) = 1$.
Then $n | mb$, so from corollary 1.11, we know $n | b$.
So $c = dn | db$.

***1.16*** Obvious, skip

***1.17***  Prove that if $p$ is prime, and $p$ divides a product of integers $a_1 ··· a_s$, then
$p$ divides one of the integers $a_i$. (Try induction, or another use of the well-ordering principle.)

Proof. Let $m$ be the smallest integer such that $p | a_1 \cdots a_m$, but
$p \nmid a_i$. Then $p | a_1 \cdots a_{m-1}$, then we have a contradiction.

***1.18*** Let $p \ne 0, ±1$ be an integer. Prove that $p$ is prime if and only if for all $a ∈ Z$, either $p | a$ or $\gcd(a, p) = 1$.

Proof. Assume $p$ is prime. And $\gcd(a, p) = b$, then $p = bq, a = ba'$.
Then $p | qa=bqa'$. If $p | q$, then $b = 1$. Otherwise $p | a$.

Conversely, assume $p | ab$, if $p \nmid a$, then $\gcd(a, p) = 1$.
According to corollary 1.11, $p | b$. Then $p$ is prime.

***1.19*** Prove that if $p$ is prime, $a, n ∈ Z$, with $n ≥ 0$, and $p | a^n$, then $p^n | a^n$.

Proof. $p$ is prime, and $p| a^n$, then based onex 1.17 so $p | a$.
Assume $a = pq$ then $a^n = (pq)^n$, so $p^n | a^n$.

***1.21*** 

$$
n = 2^{v_2} 3^{v_3} 5^{v_5} 7^{v_7} 11^{v_{11}} ··· \\
c = 2^{r_2} 3^{r_3} 5^{r_5} 7^{r_7} 11^{r_{11}} ···
$$

Proof. Assume $c | n$, and $r_p > v_p$ for some $p$.
$$
n = p^{v_p} n' \\
c = p^{r_p} c' \\
$$

$p \nmid n'$, but $c | n$, we have $p^{r_p - v_p} | n'$ we have a contradiction.

The solution is cleaner.

***1.23*** Let $a, b$ be positive integers. Prove that $\gcd(a, b) \text{lcm}(a, b) = ab.$

Proof

$$
\gcd(a, b) \text{lcm}(a, b) = \\
2^{\min(a_2, b_2)} 3^{\min(a_3, b_3)} \cdots
2^{\max(a_2, b_2)} 3^{\max(a_3, b_3)} \cdots = \\
2^{\min(a_2, b_2) + \max(a_2, b_2)} 3 ^{\min(a_3, b_3) + \max(a_3, b_3)} = \\
2^{a_2+b_2} 3^{a_3+b_3} \cdots = a b
$$
***1.24*** Let $a, b ∈ Z$, and assume that $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and that $ab$ is a perfect square (that
is, $ab = n^2$ for some integer $n$). Prove that $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares.

Proof.

$$
a = 2^{\alpha_2} 3^{\alpha_3} \cdots \\
b = 2^{\beta_2} 3^{\beta_3} \cdots \\
$$
Then $(\alpha_i + \beta_i)$ is even. Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then either
$\alpha_i$ or $\beta_i$ is even, then both of them are even.
So both $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares.

***1.25***  Let $p > 0$ be an irreducible integer. Prove that $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational. (Hint: If not,
then $\sqrt{p} = a/b$ for some integers a and b. This implies $a^2 = pb^2$. What does the Fundamental Theorem tell you in this case?)

Proof:

$$
a = 2^{\alpha_2} 3^{\alpha_3} \cdots p^{\alpha_p} \cdots \\
b = 2^{\beta_2} 3^{\beta_3} \cdots p^{\beta_p} \cdots \\
$$
Then we have $2 \alpha_p = 1 + 2 \beta_p$, which is not possible.

## 2.1 Equivalence Relations and Quotients
## 2.2 Congruence mod $n$

***definition 2.1*** Let $n ≥ 0$ be an integer, and let $a, b ∈ Z$x. We say that '$a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$', denoted $a ≡ b$ mod $n$, if $b − a ∈ nZ$.

$$
a \equiv b \mod n \iff n | b - a
$$

* For any nonnegative integer $n$ and any integer $a$,
we denote by $[a]_n$ the equivalence class of $a$ with respect to the relation of congruence
modulo $n$. Explicitly:

$$
[a]_n = \\
\{b \in \mathbb{Z} | a \equiv b \mod n\} = \\
\{b \in \mathbb{Z} | n \text{ divides } b - a\} = \\
\{b = a + nk | k \in \mathbb{Z} \}
$$

***definition 2.5*** For any integer $n ≥ 0$ we denote by $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ the set of congruence classes
mod $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. This set is called the ‘quotient of $\mathbb{Z}$ modulo $n\mathbb{Z}$’, or simply ‘$\mathbb{Z}$ mod n’.

***lemma 2.6***  Let $n$ be a positive integer.

* Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, and let $r$ be the remainder after division of $a$ by $n$. Then $[a]_n = [r]_n$.
* The classes $[0]_n, \dots, [n-1]_n$ are all distinct.

Proof. Assume $a = qn + r$, then $a - r = nq$, so $n | a - r$. Then
$a \equiv r \mod n$. So $[a]_n = [r]_n$.

Assume $[i]_n = [j]_n$ and $0 \le i, j \le n-1$, then $n | i - j$.
Then we have $i = j$.

***theorem 2.7*** For all positive integers n, the set Z/nZ consists of exactly n elements: $[0]_n, \dots, [n-1]_n$.

***Remark 2.8***  If $n = 0$, we can still make sense of the quotient, i.e., of $\mathbb{Z}/0\mathbb{Z}$. the equivalence class $[a]_0$ of
an integer $a$ consists of the single element $a$: $[a]_0 = \{a\}$.
Therefore, the set $\mathbb{Z}/0\mathbb{Z}$ is just a copy of $\mathbb{Z}$ itself.

## 2.3 Algebra in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$

***lemma 2.9*** Let $n ≥ 0$ be an integer, and let $a, a', b, b'$ be integers.

(i) $a+b \equiv a'+b' \mod n$
(ii) $a\cdot b \equiv a' \cdot b' \mod n$

***definition 2.10*** Let $n ≥ 0$ be an integer, and let $[a]_n, [b]_n$ be elements of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. We define

$$
[a]_n + [b]_n := [a + b]_n , \\
[a]_n · [b]_n := [a · b]_n .
$$

* What do we learn from this example (example 2.11)?
    * We would say that the operation we just tried to define on our     
    equivalence classes $[a]_∼$ is not well-defined.
    * It is not a viable 
    definition, because the outcome of the operation depends on how we choose
    to write our elements.
    * Whether you decide to call the first class
    $[0]_∼$ or $[−2]_∼$ cannot affect the result of an
    operation depending on this class: the operation should depend on the
    class itself, not on your mood of the moment on how you decide to call 
    the class.

## 2.4 Properties of the Operations +, · on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$

***theorem 2.13*** For every positive integer $n$, all of these properties hold for $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ with $0 = [0]_n$ and $1 = [1]_n$.

***theorem 2.15*** Let $n > 1$. Then the following assertions are equivalent:

(i) The integer n is prime.
(ii) In $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, property (2.2) is satisfied: $∀a, b, ab = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0$.
(iii) In $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, property (2.4) is satisfied: if $a \ne 0$, then $a$ has a multiplicative inverse.

Proof. 

(i) $\implies$ (ii). If $n$ is prime and $n | ab$, then $n | a$ or $n | b$.
So $a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0$.

(ii) $\implies$ (iii). Assume $ab = ab'$, then $a(b-b')=0$, then $b = b'$.
Then $ab \ne ab'$ if $b \ne b$. So $ab$ is different for all $0, n-1$.
There must be some $b$, such that $ab=1$.

(iii) $\implies$ (i). Assume $a | n$, and $ab = 1$. Then. $n | ab-1$, then
$a | ab - 1$, then $a | 1$. So $a = 1$. Then $n$ is irreducible and thus prime.

(i) $\implies$ (iii). If $n$ is prime, then $\gcd(1, n) = 1$. So
$ab + nq = 1$. So $n | nq = ab - 1$. So $ab = 1$.

(iii) $\implies$ (ii). $n | ab$, $n \nmid a$. Let $a' = \gcd(a, n)$, since $a'b' = 1$,
then $a' | a'b'-1$, so $a' | 1$, then $a' = 1$.
Then $n | b$.

(ii) $\implies$ (i) This is the definition of prime.

## Exercise

pg 422

2.1 Prove that if $a ≡ b \mod n$ and $k | n$, then $a ≡ b \mod k$.

Proof. $n | a - b$ and $k | n$, then $k | a - b$. Then $a ≡ b \mod k$.

2.2 Prove that if $a ≡ b \mod q$ for all positive irreducible integers $q$, then $a = b$.

Proof. consider $n = a - b$, since there exists infinit many irreducible integers, we can find $q > n$ and $q$ is irreducible. Since $q | n$, then
$n = 0$, and $a = b$.

2.3 Prove that if $q ≥ 5$ and $q$ is irreducible, then $[q]_6 = [1]_6$ or $[q]_6 = [5]_6$.

Proof. Because it cannot be $[0]_6, [2]_6, [3]_6$. Then would mean $6 | q$
or $2 | q$ or $3 | q$.

2.4  Find a proof or a counterexample of the following statement: If 
$[a]_n \ne [0]_n$, and
$[a]_n[b]_n = [a]_n[c]_n$, then $[b]_n = [c]_n$.

counterexample: Let
$$
[a]_n = [2]_6 \\
[b]_n = [1]_6 \\
[c]_n = [4]_6 \\
$$

2.5 Find a class $[a]_{99} \ne [0]_{99}$ in $\mathbb{Z}/99\mathbb{Z}$ such that there is no integer $b$ for which
$[a]_{99}[b]_{99} = [1]_{99}$.

Solution: for example let $a = 3$. Because $3 | 3b - 99q$, $3b \not\equiv 1 \mod 99$.

2.6 Assume that $[a]_n = [1]_n$. Prove that $\gcd(a, n) = 1$.
Find an example showing that the converse is not true.

Proof. $a - 1 = kn$, then $1 = a - kn$. Assume $\gcd(a, n) = b$,
then $b | a$, $b | n$, then $b | a - kn = 1$. So $b = 1$.

Conversely, let $a = 2, n = 5$, $[2]_5 \ne [1]_5$, but $\gcd(2,5) = 1$.

2.7 Prove that every positive integer is congruent modulo 9 to the sum of its digits.

Proof. 

$$
a_n\cdots a_1 a_0 = 10^na_n + \cdots + 10 a_1 + a_0 \\
= (9+1)^na_n + \cdots (9+1)a_1 + a_0 \\
= (9b_n+1)a_n + \cdots (9+1)a_1 + a_0 \\
= 9K + (a_n + \dots + a_1 + a_0)
$$

2.8  Find the last digit of $7^1000000$.

Solution: it's $7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1, \dots$, so it's 1.

2.9  Find a congruence class $[a]_7$ in $\mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z}$ such that every class $[b]_7$ except $[0]_7$ equals a power of $[a]_7$.

Solution: 

$$
2, 4, 1, 2 \\
3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 3\\
4, 2, 1, 4 \\
5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 5\\
6, 1, 6
$$

2.10  Let $n > 0$ be an odd integer that may be written as the sum of two perfect
squares. Prove that $[n]_4 = [1]_4$.

$$
n = n_1^2 + n_2^2 = (2k_1)^2 + (2k_2+1)^2 = 4K + 1  
$$

2.11  Prove that for all $a ∈ \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, $a · 0 = 0$ (where 0 stands for $[0]_n$).

Proof: $a \cdot n \cdot q \equiv 0 \mod n$.

# Appendix

## A.8 Relations; Equivalence Relations and Quotient Sets

* 'Functions' from a set $A$ to a set $B$ are certain subsets of the Cartesian
product $A × B$. More generally, a ‘relation’ between elements of $A$ and elements of $B$ is
any subset $R ⊆ A×B$. We say that $a ∈ A$ and $b ∈ B$ are ‘related by $R$’ if $(a, b) ∈ R$.

* An 'order' relation $R$ satisfies the following three properties. Writing $aRb$ for $(a, b) ∈ R$, we have that $R$ is
  * reflexive, i.e., $aRa$ for every $a ∈ A$;
  * transitive, i.e., $aRb$ and $bRc$ imply $aRc$ for all $a, b, c ∈ A$;
  * antisymmetric, i.e., $aRb$ and $bRa$ imply $a = b$, for all $a, b ∈ A$.

***Example A.19*** The ordinary relation $≤$ on $Z$ is an order relation.

* Of paramount importance in many constructions is the notion of equivalence relation.
A relation $∼$ on a set $A$ is an ‘equivalence relation’ when it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, that is:
  * $\forall a \in A, a \sim a$
  * $\forall a, b \in A, a \sim b \implies b \sim a$
  * $\forall a, b, c \in A, a \sim b \wedge b \sim c \implies a \sim c$.

***Example A.20***  The ‘equality’ relation $=$ is an equivalence relation, on any set $A$.

***Example A.21*** Another example may be given by letting $A = Z$ and defining $a \sim b$ to mean that $b − a$ is even.

* If a set $A$ is endowed with an equivalence relation $\sim$, we can define an associated set $A/\sim$, which we call the ‘quotient of $A$ modulo ∼’.
  * This is a prototype for all the ‘quotient’ constructions for rings, 
  modules, groups, that are among the most important
  notions developed in this text.
* The elements of this set are the ‘equivalence classes’ of
the elements of A ‘modulo ∼’, defined by

$$
[a]_{\sim} = \{b \in A  | b \sim a \}
$$

* With this notation, we define

$$
A / \sim = \{[a]_{\sim} | a \in A\}
$$

***Example A.22*** Consider the equivalence relation defined on $\mathbb{Z}$ in Example A.21, by
setting $a \sim b$ if and only if $b − a$ is even. The equivalence class of $0$ is

$$
[0]_{\sim} = \{b \in \mathbb{Z}  | n - 0 \text{ is even } \} \\
[1]_{\sim} = \{b \in \mathbb{Z}  | n - 1 \text{ is even } \} 
$$

* Using the terminology introduced above, the quotient set $Z/\sim$ consists of just two
elements. Notice that the corresponding two subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ (that is, the set of even integers
and the set of odd integers) are not empty, they are disjoint, and their union is $\mathbb{Z}$.

* It is easy to
verify that the equivalence classes modulo an equivalence relation ∼ on a set $A$ always
form a ‘partition’ of $A$: this means that the equivalence classes are
  * nonempty
  * disjoint
  * their union is the whole set $A$.

* Conversely, if $\mathcal{P}$ is a partition of a set $A$, that is, a collection of subsets of $A$ satisfy-
ing the conditions listed in the previous paragraph, then we can define an equivalence relation $\sim_\mathcal{P}$ on $A$ by setting

$$
a \sim_\mathcal{P} b \iff
\text{a and b belong to the same element of } \mathcal{P}
$$

* if the partition $\mathcal{P}$ arises
from an equivalence relation ∼, i.e., it equals the quotient $A/\sim$, then

$$
a \sim_\mathcal{P} b \iff [a]_∼ = [b]_∼ \iff a ∼ b :
$$

* that is, the equivalence relation $\sim_\mathcal{P}$ corresponding to this partition is nothing but the
equivalence relation ∼ we started from.
