# 1 The Integers

## 1.1 The Well-Ordering Principle and Induction

***definition 1.1*** Let $a, b ∈ Z$. We say that ‘b divides a’, or ‘b is a divisor of a’, or ‘a is a multiple of b’, and write $b | a$, if there is an integer $c$ such that $a = bc$.
 
***lemma1.2*** If $b|a$ and $a \ne 0$,then $|b|≤|a|$.

***FACT (Well-ordering principle)*** Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers
contains a least element.

## 1.2

## 1.3 Greatest Common Divisors

***definition 1.5*** Let $a, b ∈ \mathbb{Z}$. We say that a nonnegative integer $d$ is the ‘greatest common divisor’ of a and b, denoted $\gcd(a, b)$ or simply $(a, b)$, if

* $d | a$ and $d | b$ and
* if $c | a$ and $c | b$, then $c | d$.

* Notes: for the 2nd part, not to use $c \le d$.

***theorem 1.8*** Let $a, b$ be integers. Then the greatest common divisor $d = \gcd(a, b)$ is an integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$. That is, there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $d = ma + nb$.

In fact, if $a$ and $b$ are not both 0, then $\gcd(a, b)$ is the smallest positive linear combination of $a$ and $b$.

* Sketch of proof: Use the well-ordering principle.

***corollary 1.9*** Let $a, b$ be integers. Then $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ if and only if 1 may be expressed as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$.

***definition 1.10***  We say that a and b are relatively prime if $\gcd(a, b) = 1$.

***corollary 1.11*** Let $a, b, c$ be integers. If $a | bc$ and $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $a | c$.

***theorem 1.14 (Euclidean algorithm)*** Let $a, b$ be integers, with $b \ne 0$. Then, with notation as above, $\gcd(a, b)$ equals the last nonzero remainder $r_n$.

***lemma 1.15*** Let $a, b, q, r$ be integers, with $b \ne 0$, and assume that $a = bq + r$. Then $\gcd (a, b) = \gcd (b,r)$.

Proof. Assume $\gcd (a, b) = r'$, then $r' | r$. And assume $\gcd (b,r) = r''$, then $r'' | a$, so $r'' | r'$. On the other hand $r' | r''$, so $r' = r''$.

The textbook's approach is also clean, it shows the $a,b$ and $b,r$ have
the same set of common divisor.

## 1.4 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

***definition 1.17*** An integer $p$ is ‘irreducible’ if $p \neq ±1$ and the only divisors of $p$ are $±1, ±p$. An integer $\neq 0$,  $\neq ±1$ is ‘reducible’ or ‘composite’ if it is not irreducible.

***lemma 1.18*** Assume that $p$ is an irreducible integer and that $b$ is not a multiple of $p$. Then $b$ and $p$ are relatively prime, that is, $\gcd(p, b) = 1$.

Proof. Assume $c | p$ and $c | b$, because $p$ is irreducible, then $c = ±1, ±p$. Since $p \nmid b$, then $c$ can only be 1.

***definition 1.19*** An integer $p$ is ‘prime’ if $p \ne ±1$ and whenever $p$ divides the product $bc$ of two integers $b$, $c$, then $p$ divides $b$ or $p$ divides $c$.

***theorem 1.21*** Let $p ∈ Z$, $p \ne 0$. Then $p$ is prime if and only if it is irreducible.

Proof. Assume $p$ is prime and if $a | p$, so $p = ab$, then $p | a$ or $p | b$. Assume $p|a$, then $a = \pm p$. If $p | b$, then $a = \pm1$. So $p$ is
irreducible.

On the other hand, if $p$ is irreducible and assume $p | bc$. Consider
$\gcd(p, b)$. If $\gcd(p, b) = 1$, then $p | c$. If $\gcd(p, b) = p$, then
$p | b$.

***theorem 1.22***  (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) Every integer $n \ne 0,  ±1$ is
a product of finitely many irreducible integers: $∀n ∈ Z, n \ne 0, n \ne ±1$, there exist
irreducible integers $q_1,..., q_r$ such that

$$
n = q_1 ··· q_r
$$
Proof: The existence, use contradiction and well-ordering principle.
Assume $n$ is the smallest integer that cannot be a product of irreducible integers. And $n$ cannot be irreducible itself. So assume $n = ab$, because
$n$ is the smallest such integer, $a, b$ must be a product of irreducible integers. So we have a contradiction.

The uniqueness, again use contradiction and well-ordering principle.
Assume $n$ is the smallest integer such that it has two different
factorization.
$$
n = q_1 ··· q_r = p_1 ... p_s
$$
Because $q_1$ is prime, so $q_1 | p_1$, but $p_1$ is irreducible, so
$q_1 = p_1$. So

$$
n = q_1 ··· q_r = q_1 ... p_s
$$
And let

$$
m = q_2 ... q_r = p_2 ... p_s
$$

$m < n$ and it has two different factorization. We have a contradiction.

* We will see later $\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD (‘unique factorization domain’).

***proposition 1.25*** Let a, b be nonzero integers, and write

$$
a = 2^{\alpha_2} 3^{\alpha_3} \cdots \\
b = 2^{\beta_2} 3^{\beta_3} \cdots \\
$$

Then the gcd of $a$ and $b$ is the positive integer

$$
d = 2^{\delta_2} 3^{\delta_3} \cdots \\
$$
where $\delta_i = \min(\alpha_i, \beta_i)$.

Proof: If 

$$
c = 2^{\gamma_2} 3^{\gamma_3} \cdots
$$

is a commond divisor. Then $\gamma_i \le \min(\alpha_i, \beta_i) = \delta_i$.
So $c | d$.

* least common multiple (lcm) is similarly obtained by taking exponents $\max(α_i, β_i)$. (The ‘least common multiple’ of $a$
and $b$ is what it says it should be: a number that is a multiple of $a$ and a multiple of $b$,
and such that every common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is a multiple of $l$.)

***corollary 1.27*** Two nonzero integers a, b are relatively prime if and only if they have no common irreducible factor.

## Exercises

***1.2*** ◃ Prove that divisibility is an order relation on the set $Z^{≥0}$ of nonnegative integers. That is, prove that for all positive integers a, b, c:

(i) $a|a$;
(ii) if $a|b$ and $b|c$,then $a|c$;
(iii) if $a|b$ and $b|a$ ,then $a=b$.

Is this order relation a total ordering? Does it have a ‘maximum’? (That is, is there an integer $m$ such that $∀a ∈ Z^{≥0}, a | m?)$

Proof: 

(i) $a = a \cdot 1$
(ii) $b = aa_0, c = bb_0$, so $c = aa_0b_0$. So $a | c$
(iii) From lemma 1.2, $a | b$, so $a \le b$. $b | a$, so $b \le a$. So $a = b$.

This is not a total ordering. Consider $a = 2, b = 3$, $a \nmid b$ and $b \nmid a$.
$0$ is a maximum.

***1.8*** ◃ Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $a$ and $b$ be integers. Prove that $a$ and $b$ have
the same remainder when divided by $n$ if and only if $a − b = nk$ for some integer $k$.

Proof:

if $a − b = nk$, let $a = pn+r, b = qn+s$, then $pn+r = qn+s+kn$.
So
$$
r - s = (p-q-k)n
$$
So $n \mid r-s$. Because $0 \le r, s<n$, so $|r-s| < n$, we must have $r = s$.

On the other hand, if $r = s$, then $a - b = (p - q)n$.

***1.10*** ◃Suppose $\gcd(a,b)=1$. Prove that if $a|c$ and $b|c$,then $ab|c$.

Proof: Since $\gcd(a,b)=1$, we have $ma + nb = 1$. Also assume
$c = ap, c = bq$, then $c = mac + nbc = mabq + nbap = (mq+np)ab$.
So $ab | c$.

***1.11*** Prove that if $a|(b+c)$ and $\gcd(b,c)=1$,then $\gcd(a,b)=1$.

Proof:

$$
b+c = pa, \\
1 = mb + nc, \\
1 = mb+n(pa-b) = (m-n)b + npa.
$$
***1.12*** Prove that if $\gcd(a, c) = 1$ and $\gcd(b, c) = 1$,
then $\gcd(ab, c) = 1$.

Proof:

$$
1 = ma + nc, \\
1 = pb + qc, \\
1 = (ma + nc)(pb + qc) = mpab + (maq+npb+nqc)c
$$
***1.13*** Prove that if $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $\gcd(a^r, b^s) = 1$ for all positive integers $r, s$.

Proof: From 1.12, we know $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, so $\gcd(a^2, b) = 1$.
Then using induction, we can prove $\gcd(a^r, b) = 1$ for all $r$.
Then using 1.12 again, we can prove $\gcd(a^r, b^2) = 1$.
Then using induction again, we can prove $\gcd(a^r, b^s) = 1$

***1.14*** Prove that if $c > 0$, then $\gcd(ca, cb) = c · \gcd(a, b)$.

Proof. Assume $\gcd(ca, cb) = e$, $d = \gcd(a, b)$, then $cd | ca$ and $cd | cb$ so $cd | e$.
Now it's clear $c | e$, then assume $e = cd'$, then $d' | a$ and $d' | b$,
so $d' | d$. So $e = cd' | cd$, so $\gcd(ca, cb) = e = cd$.

***1.15*** Prove that if $c | ab$ and $\gcd(a, c) = d$, then $c | db$.

Proof. Assume $a = dm$ and $c = dn$ and $\gcd(m, n) = 1$.
Then $n | mb$, so from corollary 1.11, we know $n | b$.
So $c = dn | db$.

***1.16*** Obvious, skip

***1.17***  Prove that if $p$ is prime, and $p$ divides a product of integers $a_1 ··· a_s$, then
$p$ divides one of the integers $a_i$. (Try induction, or another use of the well-ordering principle.)

Proof. Let $m$ be the smallest integer such that $p | a_1 \cdots a_m$, but
$p \nmid a_i$. Then $p | a_1 \cdots a_{m-1}$, then we have a contradiction.

***1.18*** Let $p \ne 0, ±1$ be an integer. Prove that $p$ is prime if and only if for all $a ∈ Z$, either $p | a$ or $\gcd(a, p) = 1$.

Proof. Assume $p$ is prime. And $\gcd(a, p) = b$, then $p = bq, a = ba'$.
Then $p | qa=bqa'$. If $p | q$, then $b = 1$. Otherwise $p | a$.

Conversely, assume $p | ab$, if $p \nmid a$, then $\gcd(a, p) = 1$.
According to corollary 1.11, $p | b$. Then $p$ is prime.

***1.19*** Prove that if $p$ is prime, $a, n ∈ Z$, with $n ≥ 0$, and $p | a^n$, then $p^n | a^n$.

Proof. $p$ is prime, and $p| a^n$, then based onex 1.17 so $p | a$.
Assume $a = pq$ then $a^n = (pq)^n$, so $p^n | a^n$.

***1.21*** 

$$
n = 2^{v_2} 3^{v_3} 5^{v_5} 7^{v_7} 11^{v_{11}} ··· \\
c = 2^{r_2} 3^{r_3} 5^{r_5} 7^{r_7} 11^{r_{11}} ···
$$

Proof. Assume $c | n$, and $r_p > v_p$ for some $p$.
$$
n = p^{v_p} n' \\
c = p^{r_p} c' \\
$$

$p \nmid n'$, but $c | n$, we have $p^{r_p - v_p} | n'$ we have a contradiction.

The solution is cleaner.

***1.23*** Let $a, b$ be positive integers. Prove that $\gcd(a, b) \text{lcm}(a, b) = ab.$

Proof

$$
\gcd(a, b) \text{lcm}(a, b) = \\
2^{\min(a_2, b_2)} 3^{\min(a_3, b_3)} \cdots
2^{\max(a_2, b_2)} 3^{\max(a_3, b_3)} \cdots = \\
2^{\min(a_2, b_2) + \max(a_2, b_2)} 3 ^{\min(a_3, b_3) + \max(a_3, b_3)} = \\
2^{a_2+b_2} 3^{a_3+b_3} \cdots = a b
$$
***1.24*** Let $a, b ∈ Z$, and assume that $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and that $ab$ is a perfect square (that
is, $ab = n^2$ for some integer $n$). Prove that $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares.

Proof.

$$
a = 2^{\alpha_2} 3^{\alpha_3} \cdots \\
b = 2^{\beta_2} 3^{\beta_3} \cdots \\
$$
Then $(\alpha_i + \beta_i)$ is even. Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then either
$\alpha_i$ or $\beta_i$ is even, then both of them are even.
So both $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares.

***1.25***  Let $p > 0$ be an irreducible integer. Prove that $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational. (Hint: If not,
then $\sqrt{p} = a/b$ for some integers a and b. This implies $a^2 = pb^2$. What does the Fundamental Theorem tell you in this case?)

Proof:

$$
a = 2^{\alpha_2} 3^{\alpha_3} \cdots p^{\alpha_p} \cdots \\
b = 2^{\beta_2} 3^{\beta_3} \cdots p^{\beta_p} \cdots \\
$$
Then we have $2 \alpha_p = 1 + 2 \beta_p$, which is not possible.
