# 1 The Integers

## 1.1 The Well-Ordering Principle and Induction

***definition 1.1*** Let $a, b ∈ Z$. We say that ‘b divides a’, or ‘b is a divisor of a’, or ‘a is a multiple of b’, and write $b | a$, if there is an integer $c$ such that $a = bc$.
 
***lemma1.2*** If $b|a$ and $a \ne 0$,then $|b|≤|a|$.

***FACT (Well-ordering principle)*** Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers
contains a least element.

## 1.3 Greatest Common Divisors

***definition 1.5*** Let $a, b ∈ \mathbb{Z}$. We say that a nonnegative integer $d$ is the ‘greatest common divisor’ of a and b, denoted $\gcd(a, b)$ or simply $(a, b)$, if

* $d | a$ and $d | b$ and
* if $c | a$ and $c | b$, then $c | d$.

* Notes: for the 2nd part, not to use $c \le d$.

***theorem 1.8*** Let $a, b$ be integers. Then the greatest common divisor $d = \gcd(a, b)$ is an integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$. That is, there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $d = ma + nb$.

In fact, if $a$ and $b$ are not both 0, then $\gcd(a, b)$ is the smallest positive linear combination of $a$ and $b$.

* Sketch of proof: Use the well-ordering principle.

***corollary 1.9*** Let $a, b$ be integers. Then $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ if and only if 1 may be expressed as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$.

***corollary 1.11*** Let $a, b, c$ be integers. If $a | bc$ and $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $a | c$.

## Exercises

***1.2*** ◃ Prove that divisibility is an order relation on the set $Z^{≥0}$ of nonnegative integers. That is, prove that for all positive integers a, b, c:

(i) $a|a$;
(ii) if $a|b$ and $b|c$,then $a|c$;
(iii) if $a|b$ and $b|a$ ,then $a=b$.

Is this order relation a total ordering? Does it have a ‘maximum’? (That is, is there an integer $m$ such that $∀a ∈ Z^{≥0}, a | m?)$

Proof: 

(i) $a = a \cdot 1$
(ii) $b = aa_0, c = bb_0$, so $c = aa_0b_0$. So $a | c$
(iii) From lemma 1.2, $a | b$, so $a \le b$. $b | a$, so $b \le a$. So $a = b$.

This is not a total ordering. Consider $a = 2, b = 3$, $a \nmid b$ and $b \nmid a$.
$0$ is a maximum.

***1.8*** ◃ Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $a$ and $b$ be integers. Prove that $a$ and $b$ have
the same remainder when divided by $n$ if and only if $a − b = nk$ for some integer $k$.

Proof:

if $a − b = nk$, let $a = pn+r, b = qn+s$, then $pn+r = qn+s+kn$.
So
$$
r - s = (p-q-k)n
$$
So $n \mid r-s$. Because $0 \le r, s<n$, so $|r-s| < n$, we must have $r = s$.

On the other hand, if $r = s$, then $a - b = (p - q)n$.

***1.10*** ◃Suppose $\gcd(a,b)=1$. Prove that if $a|c$ and $b|c$,then $ab|c$.

Proof: Since $\gcd(a,b)=1$, we have $ma + nb = 1$. Also assume
$c = ap, c = bq$, then $c = mac + nbc = mabq + nbap = (mq+np)ab$.
So $ab | c$.

***1.11*** Prove that if $a|(b+c)$ and $\gcd(b,c)=1$,then $\gcd(a,b)=1$.

Proof:

$$
b+c = pa, \\
1 = mb + nc, \\
1 = mb+n(pa-b) = (m-n)b + npa.
$$
***1.12*** Prove that if $\gcd(a, c) = 1$ and $\gcd(b, c) = 1$,
then $\gcd(ab, c) = 1$.

Proof:

$$
1 = ma + nc, \\
1 = pb + qc, \\
1 = (ma + nc)(pb + qc) = mpab + (maq+npb+nqc)c
$$
***1.13*** Prove that if $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $\gcd(a^r, b^s) = 1$ for all positive integers $r, s$.

Proof: From 1.12, we know $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, so $\gcd(a^2, b) = 1$.
Then using induction, we can prove $\gcd(a^r, b) = 1$ for all $r$.
Then using 1.12 again, we can prove $\gcd(a^r, b^2) = 1$.
Then using induction again, we can prove $\gcd(a^r, b^s) = 1$
