# Chapter 2 The natural numbers

## 2.1 The Peano axioms

* **_Axiom 2.1_** 0 is a natural number.
* **_Axiom 2.2_** If $n$ is a natural number, then $n++$ is also a natural number.
* **_Axiom 2.3_** $0$ is not the successor of any natural number; i.e. we have $n++ \ne 0$
  for any $n$.
* **_Axiom 2.4_**
